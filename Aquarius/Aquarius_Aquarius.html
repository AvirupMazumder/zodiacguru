        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aquarius & Aquarius</span> Sexual and Intimacy Compatibility</h2></u>
        <p>Two Aquarius partners can have a very interesting sexual relationship, full of excitements and experimentation. They will fulfill each other’s fantasies without any repression, and easily find a language in which to connect their strange sexualities. Both of these partners will have trouble fitting in the usual stereotypes of sexuality and will rarely understand the usual taboos and restrictions other people tend to impose.</p>
        <p>Still, they could find an obstacle in emotional bonding that could present itself through a general lack of intimacy in their sex life. This will not quench the desire they will feel when they are truly attracted to one another, but they could be too detached for any of the partners to give enough warmth or focus to their relationship. This is why as soon as the first excitement and attraction start to fade, and the need for true emotional contact emerges, they might have trouble staying together.</p>
        <p>However, if they are both looking for an occasional fling, this might be the best contact of signs in the entire zodiac to have one. There will be no better understanding for the sense of freedom and the need for the lack of intimacy as these two might have in certain conditions. Unfortunately, this is usually not enough to support their future together and they will both probably need someone they could love more and who would care about them in a different way.</p>

        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aquarius & Aquarius</span> Trust</h2></u>
        <p>There is always an interesting bond between two representatives of the sign of Aquarius. They silently understand each other’s thoughts on a mental level that no other sign can reach. When they begin their relationship, their trust will be built on a foundation of freedom, so there will really be no reason for either of them to lie. If any of these partners becomes possessive, they will both be going against their beliefs if they decide to stay in this kind of relationship.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 99%;" aria-valuenow="99" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">99%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aquarius & Aquarius</span> Communication & Intellect</h2></u>
        <p>Wow. This is a conversation we would all like to be a part of. Aquarius is a sign of God’s voice and the image of the thoughts and reasoning of our higher selves. What one Aquarius tells to another might be something that only the two of them understand. Whatever their relationship might be like, when they talk, they will most certainly have an electrical connection and ideas will fly from side to side as if the conversation was their playground.</p>
        <p>The problem in their intellectual contact can show up because of their ego issues and this is almost inevitable with two such strong individuals. The Sun represents our self-esteem, respect and individuality, and it is in its detriment in the sign of Aquarius. This could be the reason of a very unpleasant conflict between their personalities, for both of these partners have the need to set strong boundaries and easily get lost in their extreme individualities. The best cure for this situation is for each of them to slow down, breathe in, and ask themselves – do they really give each other enough freedom to be who they are?</p>

        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aquarius & Aquarius</span> Emotions</h2></u>
        <p>Aquarius isn’t that emotional in a typical sense, but this doesn’t mean they are not emotional at all. Their love is in a way shared on a group of people and although it is not that romantic, it is very important to them as the foundation of their entire belief system. When it comes to a romantic relationship, two Aquarius partners could feel a lot for each other, but are more likely to perceive each other as friends.</p>
        <p>If they do fall in love, as representatives of a fixed sign, they will stay together for a long time although none of them really cares for how long the relationship will last. The beauty of their love is in its detachment, however strange that may sound. Since they know it will never be found with another partner, they will only get closer as soon as true emotions start to show.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 40%;" aria-valuenow="40" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">40%</b></div>
        </div>      
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aquarius & Aquarius</span> Values</h2></u>
        <p>It would be funny to assume that two members of the same sign have different values. But when we look at the sign of Aquarius we see that what they value is closely connected to their home and the way they were raised. As two rebellious, opinionated people, they need similar upbringing if they are to understand each other. The good thing is that they both value their freedom to extremes and this will connect them even when there are many other things they disagree on.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 80%;" aria-valuenow="80" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">80%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aquarius & Aquarius</span> Shared Activities</h2></u>
        <p>Maybe they are a bit selfish in the eyes of other people, but they won’t really think about it when they are together. They could go anywhere and do anything, for as long as it is interesting enough, educating enough or exciting enough. The best thing about a relationship between two Aquarius partners is that they can share extreme activities that other people don’t understand. So if one of them is into paragliding and the other into climbing Mount Everest, why wouldn’t they do these things together, one by one until all of their wishes come true?</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 99%;" aria-valuenow="99" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">99%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Summary</h2></u>
        <p>It can be strange to imagine an Aquarius in love with another Aquarius. When you study Astrology, one of the first things you will learn is that Aquarius is the sign of divorces, breakups and setting free from regimes and relationships. As a sign that carries opposition within, they are often not easy to be with for any sign of the zodiac, but this is exactly something both of them could understand in each other. If they truly respect each other, there is a great chance they will learn to understand other things in each other’s lives too.</p>
        <p>As crazy as it may sound, these two partners have a great chance of staying together because they will know each other better than anyone else could. However, they are rarely that attracted to each other, and even when they are, it is very difficult for them to form a deep emotional bond. When they do, well… the sky isn’t the limit.</p>
