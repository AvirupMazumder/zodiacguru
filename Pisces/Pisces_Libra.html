        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Pisces & Libra</span> Sexual and Intimacy Compatibility</h2></u>
        <p>Air and Water, Libra and Pisces seem to have almost nothing in common. However, we shouldn’t forget their connection through Venus, the ruler of Libra, exalted in Pisces. Since they touch each other through this sensual, loving planet, they might find true sexual satisfaction together. They can both be selfless lovers, caring more about the satisfaction of their partner than their own.</p>
        <p>Tenderness shouldn’t be an issue here for none of these partners will like too much aggression and roughness anyway. They could discover many different sexual preferences that they weren’t aware of before, through a connection of very different natures. If they weren’t connected by Venus, it would be very difficult for them to form a relationship on any kind, for their approach to life and sexuality is completely different.</p>
        <p>Libra partner wants someone strong, passionate and confident, while Pisces partner wants someone gentle, compassionate and aware of their feelings. Libra will want their sexual experiences fast and exciting, and Pisces will want them slow and sensual. The main issue of speed is usually overcome by the quickly changeable nature of Pisces, except in cases when they are too shy to jump into a sexual relation with someone as openly sexual as Libra.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 50%;" aria-valuenow="50" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">50%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Pisces & Libra</span> Trust</h2></u>
        <p>They will not understand each other well enough to share much trust. The need Libra has to be accepted and liked by other people will be wrongly interpreted by Pisces, for they don’t understand how can someone’s self-confidence be that low. That sparkly, always in love, childish, flirty nature of Pisces will be a huge turn off for Libra, who will not be able to trust someone who openly shows their interest in other people. The only way for these partners to remain in a trusting relationship is to approach it casually and build their understanding and trust from zero, as if they have never had any relationships prior to this one.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 1%;" aria-valuenow="1" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">1%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Pisces & Libra</span> Communication & Intellect</h2></u>
        <p>In many cases, Libra will cherish the optimism and the childish naïve nature of their Pisces partner. Unfortunately, they will often want to help them grow and change who they are so they could be “happier”. The problem here is in the fact that Libra doesn’t know or try to understand what would make Pisces truly happy. This is some basic disrespect and it could ruin the foundation of their entire relationship. The main challenge here is to remain in a respectful bond, however crazy Pisces might seem to their Libra partner, or however stiff and boring Libra might seem to Pisces.</p>
        <p>Their communication can be inspiring for as long as they don’t try to change each other, explain to each other how they should think or feel in certain situations, or even worse, teach each other how to behave. Pisces partner can be quite direct and spontaneous and this might endanger the image Libra is trying to maintain in the eyes of others. If they find each other’s actions inspiring in any possible way, they might reach a point in which they will truly communicate without judgment.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 5%;" aria-valuenow="5" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">5%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Pisces & Libra</span> Emotions</h2></u>
        <p>Their emotional connection is mostly presented through the adoration of Venus in the sign of Pisces. This is an everlasting love waiting to happen, and the kind that could be born between these partners in case they both overcome their ego. It will be a rare occurrence and their rationalities will weigh them down, for Libra does exalt Saturn, and Pisces are ruled by Jupiter. Their minds will probably be filled with all sorts of irrelevant information until they decide that it is simply too hard for them to be together.</p>
        <p>If they pass the point of disrespect and set strong boundaries, nurturing each other’s individuality and self-sufficiency, they might reach the point of emotional interaction. As if they didn’t have enough challenges, this will usually happen at a different time. Libra will rush into an emotional showoff, realizing that they have found love, but Pisces will not feel any love until all the dust settles and they have the time to close their eyes and feel. If their timing is off, they will probably end their relationship on good terms, not expecting much from each other in the future.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 15%;" aria-valuenow="15" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">15%</b></div>
        </div>      
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Pisces & Libra</span> Values</h2></u>
        <p>They will both value love and this is something that will connect them over everything else. With Venus at focus, they will both need to be loved and cherish those who know how to show it, hot to enjoy life, food and sex, and how to make their loved ones satisfied. This could give them a strong foundation for a sexual relationship if they are attracted to each other in the first place. The rest of their characters will differ greatly and while Libra will value consistency and stability, Pisces will value spontaneity and one’s ability to follow their heart. If they both believe that they have a mission here on Earth, and it happens that their missions cross paths, they could inspire each other to fight for what they value most – their names in the stars.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 60%;" aria-valuenow="60" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">60%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Pisces & Libra</span> Shared Activities</h2></u>
        <p>Indecisive Libra is exactly what their Pisces partner doesn’t need in order not to feel completely lost in life and all of their chosen activities. The problem here is that by the time Libra decides if they want to do something or not, Pisces will change their minds five times, not sure if this is the best thing for them, for their relationship, for their life’s purpose and mission, etc. The questioning of Libra will raise suspicions in Pisces with painful ease. They will manage to find activities they will both like, and if nothing else works they can always turn to any sort of art. The real question is – will they want to do anything while they are together? They could drain so much strength and confidence out of each other just trying to make a plan for the night.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 40%;" aria-valuenow="40" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">40%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Summary</h2></u>
        <p>Libra and Pisces have a meeting point in the beauty of Venus. Still, they perceive it in two different ways and they will often not respect each other enough to find the beauty of Venus in one another. They could have real trouble adjusting to their partner’s speed, and the mutable quality of Pisces often won’t help them open up any faster to build a relationship in the pace that would fit their Libra partner. Both Libra and Pisces can selflessly be interested in the satisfaction of their partner, and this should help them stay on the good side of their relationship whatever happens between them. If they move past the disrespect and the unrealistic expectations from each other’s personalities, they might find that they share real love.</p>
