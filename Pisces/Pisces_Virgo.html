        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Pisces & Virgo</span> Sexual and Intimacy Compatibility</h2></u>
        <p>Virgo and Pisces are opposing signs and their attraction is very strong. Since they also represent the axis of Venus’ fall and exaltation, we can conclude that their relationship always has a lesson on Venus to teach. These partners have a task to find the place of physical intimacy in which they will both be relaxed to be exactly who they are.</p>
        <p>Virgo partner will usually be shy, trying to show their sexuality through rational behavior, and Pisces will see right through this. On the other hand, Pisces will fear close physical connection with another person, and this will be practically dismissed by Virgo. As they both learn that they cannot hide who they are, they will have no choice but to set themselves free from any fear and shame, giving in to the wonderful sexual experience Venus has to offer.</p>
        <p>This is a couple that will never have instinctive sex, however passionate they might get. Virgo’s analytical mind wouldn’t allow for them to act “like animals”, and this is something that Pisces will find so humanlike and attractive. Virgo will mostly be attracted by the purity of sex with Pisces, who truly approach it as an act of love, free from prejudice and following their inner feeling, wherever it leads.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 99%;" aria-valuenow="99" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">99%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Pisces & Virgo</span> Trust</h2></u>
        <p>Virgo can have some serious trust issues that Pisces won’t actually help them overcome. In order to have a healthy relationship in which they both trust each other, they will both need to be secure and confident enough to be honest. Both of these partners will easily give in to dishonesty, although their convictions are the opposite of their behavior. It can be torture for both of them if any one of the partners tells a lie. Fortunately, they are both aware that some secrecy might even spark their relationship and give it more passion. This is why they will usually get over small intimacy outbreaks in order to trust each other on a higher level.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 65%;" aria-valuenow="65" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">65%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Pisces & Virgo</span> Communication & Intellect</h2></u>
        <p>They complement each other best through communication and intellectual stimulation. When they start their relationship, they are bound to realize how similar they actually are, even though they seem so different. The mutable quality of their signs will allow them to jump from topic to topic, both of them staying interested in the flow and the outcome of their conversations.</p>
        <p>The best person to pull Virgo out of their obsessive analysis is Pisces, with their smile and their wider picture. Pisces will give their Virgo partner faith, teach them how belief can form reality and help them be free from too much caution and fear from failure. Virgo often has this inner battle in which nothing they know, think or do is good or valuable enough. Pisces are able to inspire and find value in everything in life, and those insecurities and emotional problems of Virgo may seem like something needless that damages the self-esteem of everyone around them. They will do their best to help their partner reach the point of inner security in which they understand their worth. In return, Virgo will help Pisces reach the actual materialization of their incredible talents. They might do so through nagging and constant criticism, but in the end, Pisces will have many things to be thankful for.</p>
        <p>Not only does this relationship represent the axis of Venus’ exaltation and fall, but it also represents the axis of the exaltation and fall of Mercury. As much as Virgo has trouble with Venus, Pisces have trouble with practical Mercury and their mind can send mixed signals making them lost and confused. Virgo will help them build an inner sense of intellectual security, in return for their emotional one.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 85%;" aria-valuenow="85" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">85%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Pisces & Virgo</span> Emotions</h2></u>
        <p>There is no other sign in the zodiac that can awaken the emotional depths of Virgo better than Pisces. Understanding between them could reach points of perfection and this is something that both of them will probably be unable to find with anyone else. Still, it is important for them not to build too much expectation around this idea of perfection, for no one can meet these requirements in real life.</p>
        <p>If they go astray, losing touch with their partner’s true personality, they will easily get disappointed and have the need to end their relationship. With two mutable signs everything moves fast and changes are inevitable. If they want to remain in a stable relationship, they need to find a fine balance between rationality and emotion, reality and dreams and love each other as if they were perfect just the way they are.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 95%;" aria-valuenow="95" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">95%</b></div>
        </div>      
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Pisces & Virgo</span> Values</h2></u>
        <p>They share a great love of perfection. As much as Virgo will value one’s perfect mind, Pisces will value a perfect emotion. This is their meeting point and it can make them divine, or constantly dissatisfied with the need to change everything about their partner. Both of these partners will value flexibility, someone’s ability to adapt and change, and they will most certainly value the love they get from their partner. Still, their differences in approach to one’s beliefs and convictions might be huge, and acceptance between them needs to be unconditional.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 75%;" aria-valuenow="75" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">75%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Pisces & Virgo</span> Shared Activities</h2></u>
        <p>Virgo can be grumpy about doing anything from a fairytale of Pisces, but they will follow out of curiosity. They are after all ruled by Mercury, and have this need to see and feel everything that this Earth has to offer. Once they get into the magical world of Pisces, they could discover the beauty of life they were fully unaware of. When these partners are together, they make each other feel like anything is possible, for Pisces understand endless possibilities as much as Virgo makes things come true, understanding reality better than many others.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 99%;" aria-valuenow="99" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">99%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Summary</h2></u>
        <p>Virgo and Pisces represent the axis of the exaltation and fall of both Venus and Mercury. This makes them partners with greatest challenges and the greatest potential for love in the entire zodiac. They need to find a fine balance of rationality and emotions, each one individually and together through their relationship. In many cases this is not a couple that will last very long, as their mutable quality makes them changeable enough to disregard the entire relationship quickly if they aren’t satisfied. They need to realize that perfection they seek might not be presented in the form they expect. If they stay together for long enough to understand the benefits of their contact, they might discover that the love between them is the only true love they could find in this lifetime.</p>
