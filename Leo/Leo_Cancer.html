        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Leo & Cancer</span> Sexual and Intimacy Compatibility</h2></u>
        <p>Cancer and Leo make a very interesting couple due to the fact they are the only signs in the zodiac ruled by the lights in the sky, both of which are not planets – the Sun and the Moon. Although they don’t have much in common, in astrology they represent a husband and a wife and are the king and queen of the zodiac. Unfortunately we know how unsatisfying the sex between a king and a queen can be like. </p>
        <p>The sexual aspect of their relationship depends on the depth of their emotions. As highly emotional signs, each in their own way, they tend to show their love in different ways and this can be a bit hard to reconcile in their sex life. As a Fire sign, Leo is way more openly passionate and this could scare their Cancer away. Cancer is tender and sensitive enough to make their Leo partner feel guilty because of their nature, or Leo could simply have difficulty being tender in the way Cancer needs them to. It is as if a lion and a roe started a sexual relationship and although they don’t want to hurt each other, their primal behavior seems to pull them in that direction. </p>
        <p>Still, because of their rulers, they can get pretty close and share fine emotions in their sexual encounters. Although there won’t be much excitement to them, they could be satisfying enough for both partners if they don’t expect a wild sex life. To find middle ground they really need to be quiet and listen to each other’s needs.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 30%;" aria-valuenow="30" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">30%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Leo & Cancer</span> Trust</h2></u>
        <p>It is said that Leo likes to be in the center of everyone’s attention. This is somewhat true and Leo is a born performer, more or less supported to become one. However, their need to show off is something Cancer might find irritating, but not something to lose their trust over. If Cancer feels loved, they have no reason to doubt their partner just because of their nature. Still, the differences between them might lead to a secret search for more compatible partners and this is easily sensed by both partners.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 50%;" aria-valuenow="50" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">50%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Leo & Cancer</span> Communication & Intellect</h2></u>
        <p>Cancer and Leo, ruled by the Moon and the Sun, represent a subconscious and a conscious mind. Even if they share interests, they will often have a strangely different view on the same thing. They will often just drift apart as the conversation progresses. The Moon does reflect the light of the Sun, but it circles around the Earth. This would be fine if the Sun wasn’t so used to the fact that everyone circles around it. This explains what happens in their relationship once Leo starts talking. Although they shine, Cancer pays much more attention to someone else or to the idea of earthly things they could have together, than to their Leo partner. </p>
        <p>The base of their communication should be in things that have yet to be discovered. All the mysteries that are there to be solved could be a good starting point because they both need to understand things, each in their own area of dominance. The best possibility they have is in the things that need a light cast on them from two different angles. If they have enough respect for each other, they could learn a lot from each other’s passive and active approach to life.  </p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 10%;" aria-valuenow="10" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">10%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Leo & Cancer</span> Emotions</h2></u>
        <p>We can say with certainty that their emotions are a truly beautiful thing. Both signs represent love and although it is not the same kind of love, it is an emotion, pure and simple. Cancer is a Water sign that represent motherly love and all emotions in one’s family. Although this is not always a promise of happiness, the depth of all the love that hides within is magical. On the other hand, Leo is a Fire sign of joy, first loves, fun and sex. Their heart is warm and big, for Leo represents our inner child, and their loyalty is unchangeable when they decide to give it to someone.</p>
        <p>The main problem here is their connection, for Cancer needs to look into somebody’s eyes and feel the love, while Leo wants to shout it out from the rooftops. This could seem untrue to Cancer, as much as Leo could recognize in Cancer something that would rather tie them down than allow them to fly. Both of them have opposing signs ruled traditionally by Saturn and this is exactly why they could recognize true quality in their relationship, as each of them takes their opposing role to learn something. Usually this is not something that can last very long and they will probably both move on to find someone who is more of an image from their seventh house.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 45%;" aria-valuenow="45" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">45%</b></div>
        </div>      
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Leo & Cancer</span> Values</h2></u>
        <p>They simply don’t value the same things. Although this is the point where they separate their ways, it usually takes them long to realize this fact. Cancer values tenderness, emotions, family and a stable life with someone, while Leo values initiative, passion, energy and focus. There is rarely something that they will both value in the same way, or put in the same spot at their priority lists.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 1%;" aria-valuenow="1" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">1%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Leo & Cancer</span> Shared Activities</h2></u>
        <p>It helps that Leo would gladly sleep for 20 hours a day. This will make them available at home. They will also gladly be served by breakfast, lunch and dinner, and who better to prepare those than a caring Cancer. However, when they leave the house, they will want to visit different places. Cancer will want to visit their close friends, especially if they have babies, go for a walk by the lake or have a romantic evening at the movies. Whatever they do, they like it with a little intimacy to it. As if to oppose this, Leo will want to spend time at places where they could be seen. Their partner needs to shine to others and hold them by the hand while everyone else claps theirs. This is not often something Cancer will be ready to do, as they don’t really like to be the center of attention. On the other hand, Leo could compromise, but in the end they wouldn’t be happy if their social needs aren’t met.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 35%;" aria-valuenow="35" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">35%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Summary</h2></u>
        <p>Although the Moon reflects the light from the Sun, the sign of Cancer doesn’t really see Leo as the source of all their joy. Leo is a sign that should spread joy and love with an active approach to each one of their relationships. How is it possible that Cancer is immune? Well probably because the Moon circles around the Earth, not the Sun.</p>
        <p>They are special, that’s for sure. Both of them are strong individuals, each on their own plane. Their lack of understanding and emotional touch can be explained through the fact that both of them have a mission to spread love to the less fortunate signs of the zodiac. Not everyone is born with an emotional flow like Cancer and a huge, warm heart like Leo. If they kept all this love to themselves, some unfortunate souls would probably search for them aimlessly, and the world would be a much sadder place.</p>
