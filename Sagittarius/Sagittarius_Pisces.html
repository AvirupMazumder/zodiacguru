        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Sagittarius & Pisces</span> Sexual and Intimacy Compatibility</h2></u>
        <p>If they ever manage to end up in a physical relationship, they will have a lot of fun. As two mutable signs, there will be no end to their creativity and changes in positions, scenery and levels of commitment and intimacy. Their sex life will have ups and downs, excitements and disappointments, too many expectations and a lot of surprises. The best thing about their relationship is the positivity both partners share, and a lot of laughter and fun they will share in their sex life.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the level of intimacy will rarely be satisfying for any of these partners. Since they are both ruled by Jupiter, they will be faced with their rational natures and their convictions. The main reason why their sexual relationship rarely comes true is overthinking of both partners. Sagittarius will wait for a grand emotion, grand gesture or any sort of passionate initiative from Pisces, while Pisces will wait for all of the pieces of the puzzle to fit in their perfect position. In most cases, neither of these things will happen and they won’t move further from a platonic relationship.</p>

        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Sagittarius & Pisces</span> Trust</h2></u>
        <p>It will be very difficult for Sagittarius and Pisces to trust each other, but they will probably accept it as a perfectly normal thing. This is the beauty of Jupiter’s rule – everything makes sense in their relationship. Sagittarius partner is too passionate and loves to have a lot of options when it comes to relationships. They will rarely settle down with anyone who lacks a strong decision to win them over. Pisces, on the other hand, will be too sensitive while trying to show their imaginary strength. They could end up following their Sagittarius partner in adventures they are not ready for, sad because of the lack of emotional understanding from their partner and ready to open up to someone else. Regardless of the purpose of each little thing they do, they will often have twisted expectations from each other and this will lead to unintentional dishonesty.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 1%;" aria-valuenow="1" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">1%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Sagittarius & Pisces</span> Communication & Intellect</h2></u>
        <p>When we rule out emotional and physical sides of their relationship, a Sagittarius and a Pisces partner will be best friends, almost inseparable, for a while. There is no way to determine how long their relationship will last, and unless supported by fixed signs in their personal charts, they will rarely stay in it for long.</p>
        <p>Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter, and traditionally so is Pisces. This is the biggest planet in the Solar system and as such, it has a great influence on the personality of these signs. They will share the same optimism, the same vision and pretty much the same delusions. These partners will be linked through extremely beneficent influences and they will most certainly share the same sense of humor, operate at the same speed and learn a lot from each other for however long they are together. Jupiter is a planet of knowledge, and they will be fascinated by the unknown they can share with each other.</p>
        <p>In time, they will realize what their differences are in the most unusual way. Sagittarius is a sign of convictions and will be more rational and reliable than their Pisces partner. At some point Sagittarius will start to form a distance because of expectations that haven’t been met and the irresponsible, detached behavior of their Pisces partner. In return, Pisces will have a simple feeling that this is no longer where they want to be. Both of them might never understand why, but they will simply separate with no ill intentions, and probably not much anger or hurt. The beginning of their separation lies within disrespect of each other’s convictions and personalities.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 85%;" aria-valuenow="85" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">85%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Sagittarius & Pisces</span> Emotions</h2></u>
        <p>Their relationship will be an emotional rollercoaster for both partners, but it will rarely last very long. The relationship they will build through communication and understanding of each other’s worlds will awaken emotions through excitement and the unexpected. They will laugh with each other with open hearts and share wonderful emotions for as long as they are in the beginning of their relationship. As soon as any problems start to arise, they will both feel their emotions fade, as if the entire relationship was superficial.</p>
        <p>Whatever the circumstances, it is important for both of them to remember that there is nothing superficial about this contact. The learning process and the beauty of their entire relationship shouldn’t be forgotten, but kept as a base for all of their future relationships. They love each other in a strange way, idealizing each other, getting disappointed, choosing to stay apart even when they wish to be together. This is a complicated emotional contact because both partners easily fall in love, and the deepening of their relationship can make them both be swept off their feet. If the relationship ends in a disrespectful way, they could both lose a bit of their faith in love.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 30%;" aria-valuenow="30" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">30%</b></div>
        </div>      
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Sagittarius & Pisces</span> Values</h2></u>
        <p>The biggest difference here is the value Pisces partner gives to emotions, for Sagittarius often doesn’t really understand that approach. If they connect through deep love, they will overcome this with ease and emotions they share will make Sagittarius understand their partner. In general, they will agree on many things. They will value each other’s utopias, people with good hearts, knowledge, wide perspective and travels. They will understand each other’s sense of not belonging and share the sense of a higher power.</p>

        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Sagittarius & Pisces</span> Shared Activities</h2></u>
        <p>For as long as they are in a fascination phase of their relationship, they will be inseparable. Both of them have the need to grab everything that is offered and leave nothing joyful unused, unsaid and left for tomorrow. It is like they are both hungry for happiness in a dark world they have stumbled upon, and when they meet someone this fascinating it would be a shame to miss the opportunity to enjoy. In time they will realize that although they share the same need for movement and changes of scenery, they might not need the same contents in their lives and Sagittarius will turn to physical activity, philosophy and travel, while Pisces will usually go back to creative work and the pursuit of love.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">

        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Summary</h2></u>
        <p>This is a relationship of two kindred spirits that often doesn’t last very long. At first, it will be challenging for them to leave the platonic zone and start building a physical relationship. Once they get close to each other, their process of learning will begin and both partners will be fascinated by each other, thinking that their relationship could never end. They will easily idealize each other, think of their relationship as the perfect love, but this infatuation won’t last very long because of their changeable natures. The fact is their relationship represents a moment in time when they have both deserved to smile. For as long as it lasts and they are happy, it will be cherished by both of them.</p>
