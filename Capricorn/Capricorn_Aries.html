        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Capricorn & Aries</span> Sexual and Intimacy Compatibility</h2></u>
        <p>This is a very difficult combination of signs when it comes to sexual compatibility. Rulers of Aries and Capricorn are Mars and Saturn. These planets are considered archetypal or karmic enemies. When it comes to sexuality, it is mostly signified by Mars and its contact with Saturn may result in all sorts of physical and objective obstacles on the way to a healthy sex life. Saturn puts too much pressure on Mars and takes a lot of its energy. Their relationship will result in lack of sexual desire, the mutual feeling of incompetence or even impotence of one or both included parties. </p>
        <p>When this sort of relationship happens, it is in most cases triggered by some deep unconscious need to be held back and restricted when it comes to sexuality. As with everything that comes through the sign of Capricorn, with time Aries partner could achieve some sort of balanced state in which they are sexually satisfied and their instinctive needs are met. Unfortunately, Capricorn partner will lose their energy and the need to participate in this sort of sexual behavior by that time. This will ultimately lead to their separation, for there is nothing light or easy with these two, especially when it comes to intimate matters. </p>
        <p>Because of the unconscious type of their relationship, they could be insanely attracted to each other, but in most cases their differences will keep them at a safe distance. At their best, Capricorn will support Aries’ libido and control their passion to burn as slowly as possible. At the same time, Aries would consider their partner a teacher and learn about their body and the way to satisfy them. Still, this is a balance that is extremely hard to achieve when the clash of these two hard personalities happens.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 5%;" aria-valuenow="5" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">5%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Capricorn & Aries</span> Trust</h2></u>
        <p>Since they are both in extremes and “all or nothing” types of people, it will be easy for them to trust each other. Even if they have deep misunderstandings in other areas of their relationship, they will rarely betray each other’s trust. This is something they will easily take for granted though, for when they are together, they seem to lose awareness of the things between them that should be treasured. One of them should have the sense to remind the other from time to time about the qualities that their bond includes.   </p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 99%;" aria-valuenow="99" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">99%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Capricorn & Aries</span> Communication & Intellect</h2></u>
        <p>They should keep their conversation in touch with carrier goals, achievements at work and physical activity, for Capricorn exalts Mars, the ruler of Aries. Other than that, they don’t have much to talk about. </p>
        <p>Rarely will a Capricorn partner allow their impulsive and from their perspective even stupid Aries partner to have their own opinions and value them as useful or practical. Although they will certainly respect their initiative and energy level, the rest of Aries behavior is simply unacceptable in most matters. Since Capricorn has their feet on the ground and is capable to measure the situation rationally, they will hold on to their calm opinion about their partner’s lack of tact and endurance or even of their idiotism. You can imagine how annoying this can be to an Aries, especially if you take into consideration their passionate need to set strong boundaries and be respected in every way possible.  </p>
        <p>On the other hand, Aries will simply have no patience for their Capricorn partner. They will seem boring and as if they only want people in their life to be useful. This will be attributed to their selfishness and lack of emotion and heart.</p>
        <p>Both of them will be wrong in a way, for they would need to understand what they both could become if the right person or motivator came along. The problem is they could remain stuck in this pointless ego battle, until they both get so tired that they will hardly think of another relationship ever again.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 20%;" aria-valuenow="20" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">20%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Capricorn & Aries</span> Emotions</h2></u>
        <p>In this special case it would be best not to call this paragraph “emotions”, but “understanding”. Their problem is in the way they understand each other to begin with. At the beginning of their relationship they will both probably have an image of the other person as someone they could become after some effort is put into their growth. The problem is that no one here wants to change. Their emotions could easily be connected to this first image they’ve had, however unrealistic it might be. So this is exactly what we would call the lack of understanding, because these two could be crazy in love with each other’s false image and crazy persistent to change one another.  </p>
        <p>Their problem really isn’t the lack of emotion to each other (although you could easily contribute their issues to emotional disability considering their Mars/Saturn nature), but the lack of understanding and acceptance of each other. They are often too stubborn and narrow minded to see that there is something different than what fits into their boundaries of possible personal characteristics.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 1%;" aria-valuenow="1" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">1%</b></div>
        </div>      
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Capricorn & Aries</span> Values</h2></u>
        <p>They both value independence, clarity and honesty, and in general their system of values is not what brings problems to their relationship. Mostly they are in sync when it comes to serious view of people they are surrounded with. The problem they have is in their unrealistic expectations founded on the fact that they share some values. </p>
        <p>If Aries values someone’s ability to endure and push themselves over all possible personal barriers, that doesn’t mean they are ready to become this person, or have the control to be one. Similarly, Capricorn might value speed and focus of some people, but this doesn’t mean they will jeopardize their depth or attention to detail just to be faster, or leave deep psychological needs unattended only to stay focused at some goal.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 60%;" aria-valuenow="60" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">60%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Capricorn & Aries</span> Shared Activities</h2></u>
        <p>Capricorn sometimes just doesn’t understand why Aries wants to run at 6 in the morning. Aries doesn’t understand why Capricorn would spend all night doing something extremely boring, just to be thorough when it has no value in this particular matter. What Aries doesn’t understand is that studiousness always has its value, as much as Capricorn doesn’t understand the physical need of their body to rest and act on impulse from time to time.</p>
        <p>They can easily find activities they both like when they include physical movement. They both need to pay attention to their bodies and everyday habits, so it would be good for them to have the same physical activity every day at the same time together. This way they would motivate each other – Aries will lift up Capricorn’s energy and Capricorn would give endurance to their shared efforts. This could do wonders for their entire relationship, for they could understand each other’s natures much better through this sort of basic activity.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 40%;" aria-valuenow="40" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">40%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Summary</h2></u>
        <p>This is not an easy relationship. None of the partners has any trace of lightness and blissful ignorance. This is why their relationship might seem like a competition to ruin the relationship in the best possible way. It is hard to say who will get out of it a winner, for they will both feel lousy most of the time and be relieved that they finally separated. If they stubbornly decide they love each other too much to let each other go, both of them would probably bang their heads against a wall for years to come.</p>
        <p>Their only chance of success is unconditional respect and the wideness of their views and expectations. They could truly complement each other, but only in a scenario where they would look for good in one another and highlight each other’s qualities. Unfortunately, the malefic nature of their rulers rarely allows for them to be this positive and acceptance oriented. If they got together, and whatever their story is, they should think about the things they could learn from each other instead of looking for each other’s shortcomings, and always stay out of each other’s business.</p>
