        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Capricorn & Taurus</span> Sexual and Intimacy Compatibility</h2></u>
        <p>Taurus and Capricorn can both be quite rigid when it comes to sex. This is exactly what could make them a perfect couple. In combination with other signs of the zodiac it can be hard for them to open up and feel the need to experiment, even though Capricorn will do their best to show how ingenious they are when it comes to sex. When they get together and get to know each other intimately, they will learn what it means to relax. Capricorn won’t feel the need to show off and Taurus will let go of their fear of getting hurt.</p>
        <p>The problem in their relationship can be hidden in their understanding of the Moon, for Taurus exalts it, and Capricorn doesn’t like it very much. They could have trouble connecting on an emotional level if Capricorn doesn’t fall in love deeply enough or has trust issues. This will be multiplied by Taurus’ need to be loved unconditionally that they show in an endless loop, scaring their Capricorn away. </p>
        <p>Their different approaches to the combination of sexual instincts and love are what could make a gap between them. Taurus has a problem with initiative and aggression, not understanding Mars that well, while Capricorn needs initiative, physical strength and supports Mars. In their sex life, this could lead to a lack of emotion from Capricorn partner, leading to the frustration of Taurus, scared away by their libido with no emotional foundation. This could go as far as impotence and a general lack of sexual desire in both partners, unless they hold on to intimate nature of their sexuality and approach each other as different individuals with certain needs.</p>

        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Capricorn & Taurus</span> Trust</h2></u>
        <p>Capricorn just isn’t into lying. They don’t even judge it but find it unnecessary and stupid. Even when they do tell a lie, in most cases it is an experiment with other human beings to see if they can guess where the truth lies. When they are intimately involved, they like things between them and their partner clean and true. Taurus can easily sense this and will feel secure enough to not give in to their occasional need to hide things from their partner. Taurus is ruled by Venus, a planet exalted in the sign of Pisces, so they have this understanding of importance of secrecy when they are in love. With Capricorn, they can find a way to hide their intimacy from the rest of the world and stay true to their loved one for a very, very long time.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 99%;" aria-valuenow="99" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">99%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Capricorn & Taurus</span> Communication & Intellect</h2></u>
        <p>Although they have different natures, they understand each other very well and motivate each other to grow – each of them in their needed direction. Their differences are exactly there to make them a perfect couple, because they complement each other in a more subtle way then their opposing signs. </p>
        <p>The deep understanding of the Moon is something Taurus is blessed with and Capricorn lacks in their core. The fear of emotion can easily become a daily routine of neglect toward their personal emotional needs. Taurus has a mission to teach Capricorn about the significance of tenderness one should always have for one self. In return, Capricorn will help Taurus deal with responsibility and teach them how to reach their goals with no distracting emotions.</p>
        <p>It is not always easy for them to understand each other, but with enough compassion and openness to feel for the other person, they can support each other in a way no other pair of signs can. After all, they do belong to the element of Earth, and can make magic in our material reality when they reconcile their differences.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 85%;" aria-valuenow="85" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">85%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Capricorn & Taurus</span> Emotions</h2></u>
        <p>It is difficult to say with certainty they will find emotional fulfillment with each other because they are both very careful when it comes to love. This is usually something like a pattern to be broken when they do begin a relationship, for they have enough time and patience for one another. From the perspective of Taurus, this might not be the best emotional contact they’ve ever had, but from Capricorn’s perspective, things can’t get much better than being loved by a Taurus partner.</p>
        <p>However, there is a dose of almost unbearable satisfaction Taurus will feel when their long-term digging reaches the emotional core of their Capricorn partner. When this contact is reached, they will rarely feel the need to separate from them again. To Capricorn this may seem as if someone literally touched their heart and they will probably never want to let their Taurus partner go.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 90%;" aria-valuenow="90" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">90%</b></div>
        </div>      
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Capricorn & Taurus</span> Values</h2></u>
        <p>With shared sense for value of the material world, these two can get really far together. While Taurus would create and motivate, Capricorn would lead the way to success and financial security. Whatever their goals, they could easily reach them together due to the fact they share the same material values to begin with. Still, they don’t have such a peachy situation when it comes to their approach to emotions and family. They should observe different sides of their personalities as complementing instead of destructive and find a way to coexist giving value to each other’s shadow.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 90%;" aria-valuenow="90" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">90%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Capricorn & Taurus</span> Shared Activities</h2></u>
        <p>You could say that Taurus is lazy and Capricorn never stops working, but this is not exactly the case. If any sign in the zodiac needs rest, it would be Capricorn. Their high ambition can lead them to a state of low energy and Taurus is there to mend their tired Soul with fine food and time for joy. On the other hand, if the creative, motivating side of Taurus is awaken by the striving nature of their Capricorn partner, they will become everything but lazy and make room for both of them to be satisfied and happy with what they’ve accomplished. In short, they can do anything together, for as long as they hold on to a fine balance of activity and rest.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 85%;" aria-valuenow="85" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">85%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Summary</h2></u>
        <p>Taurus and Capricorn can form a relationship so deep that their creative power in the material realm could seem unreachable for other signs of the zodiac. With the ability to complement each other in a gentle, slow way, they are the most boring couple on the outside, with most exciting inner activity that stays hidden from the rest of the world. If Taurus motivates their Capricorn partner, and Capricorn shows the way of accomplishment to their Taurus partner, they could work together, raise children and share a life with more fun than they are both used to, or simply form an unbreakable bond. When their deep emotions intertwine, they are bound to each other for eternity.</p>
