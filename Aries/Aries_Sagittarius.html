        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aries & Sagittarius</span> Sexual and Intimacy Compatibility</h2></u>
        <p>When Aries and Sagittarius engage in sexual relations it can be quite funny. Sagittarius partner has this innate ability to make a joke out of almost anything. The seriousness of an Aries when sex is in question is something that gives Sagittarius a strong impulse to make a joke. </p>
        <p>These are two Fire signs, both very passionate, each one in their own way. Aries is passionate when it comes to action, new things and of course – naked people and specific sexual positions. Sagittarius is passionate about their cheerful personality. You have to understand that Sagittarius really only cares about their opinions, convictions and moral value. They can spend their entire life analyzing these to see if they are wrong or right and search for the universal truth. When it comes to their optimism and good mood, they passionately protect them from anything too serious or hard. If they let someone taint them, it would shake their conviction that they should always smile and find a reason to be happy. </p>
        <p>Although Aries can be a bit vain about their sexual abilities and performance, in most cases Sagittarius is able to break this wall of strict, sexual tension and lead them to a more relaxed zone where they can relax and experiment.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 95%;" aria-valuenow="95" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">95%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aries & Sagittarius</span> Trust</h2></u>
        <p>Aries and Sagittarius are both aware of the excessive need for honesty in their life. Usually they don’t have to talk much to understand each other and can easily spot when the other one is lying. This makes it extremely hard to create a situation of mistrust, especially because of the feeling of security Sagittarius partner gives to Aries, by taking everything in with dignity and serenity. In most situations Aries feels they can share anything with their Sagittarius partner.   </p>
        <p>The problem could appear if they have different views on the seriousness and depth of their relationship. If this is the case, usually a Sagittarius partner sees Aries as a short term, not that important partner. This is why they could easily cheat on them and probably wouldn’t even call it cheating. In return, Aries partner that values their relationship more, would jump into their possessive nature with even more ease and never trust their Sagittarius partner again.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 70%;" aria-valuenow="70" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">70%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aries & Sagittarius</span> Communication & Intellect</h2></u>
        <p>This is a wonderful bond that is often seen in friendships that last for years. Their mutual understanding can be so deep, that even if they lack physical attraction, they would gladly substitute it with a life spent in this kind of intellectual relationship. They motivate and push each other wherever they might like to go. When they are together, they make each other feel as if nothing is impossible. While Aries gives initiative and focus, Sagittarius gives vision and faith. </p>
        <p>These signs are ruled by Mars and Jupiter, which means that they could have some disagreements on their convictions. In case these are not convictions they think of as their personality’s foundation, this shouldn’t be a huge problem. Still, it is possible for their set of beliefs to differ too much for them to even understand each other. When this happens, they fight whenever and wherever they can, since none of them has the ability to let their convictions go. Aries because they want to win, and Sagittarius because convictions are their forte and something they have surely thought about a lot.  </p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 90%;" aria-valuenow="90" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">90%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aries & Sagittarius</span> Emotions</h2></u>
        <p>When they fall in love with each other, deeply and sincerely, it is almost possible for their passers-by to warm up in the middle of winter. These are extremely warm signs, due to their corresponding element of Fire, open for any kind of activity just to share time together and feel that wonderful emotion in their stomach. This is a love that could last for a very long time, for as long as their respect their personal needs, individuality and the distance they possibly need from each other every once in a while.  </p>
        <p>Although they are not considered very emotional, it is a mistake to assign emotionality only to the element of Water. This is an element which works from the heart and you can feel it in your chest. In search for an explanation of emotional nature of Fire signs, you should just imagine that warm feeling in your belly and that would be the best possible description. Their emotions are active, warm and on the move. Always changeable but creative and there to move them anywhere they want to go.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 90%;" aria-valuenow="90" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">90%</b></div>
        </div>      
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aries & Sagittarius</span> Values</h2></u>
        <p>Aries partner values things that are brought up to a higher level by their Sagittarius. In time they will both understand that Aries grows through this relationship and widens their entire system of values. When they started dating, Aries probably had this idea of honor and heroic “sweep off feet” logic. In time, they both must have realized that Sagittarius gives this idea a new step up and brings it into a world of royalty. Not only does Sagittarius value honorable and heroic people, too, but they value honorable people with blue blood that give money and food to the poor, every day.   </p>
        <p>Their main difference is in the fact that Aries values things concise and clear, while Sagittarius will easily disperse and go around the point for days. This can be met through their mutual value of truth, so honesty can be their cure for anything.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 70%;" aria-valuenow="70" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">70%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aries & Sagittarius</span> Shared Activities</h2></u>
        <p>Aries is a sign in which Saturn falls. This means that they easily get tired or just bored and they always need new and exciting stimulations. Sagittarius is a sign of mutable quality, ready to change whatever needs changing in order to feel good. When they get together, their activities can be shared and fun whatever they are. This has nothing to do with their needs and tendencies, but with the potential of their entire relationship. They can go for coffee and they would have fun, but they could also go bungee jumping together and have even more fun. It is all the same to them. They are fully capable of respecting each other’s personality, so even if their wishes for certain activities differ, this would be easily dealt with.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 99%;" aria-valuenow="99" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">99%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Summary</h2></u>
        <p>This is definitely a couple with lots of potential. They might have to stand up to their environment and defend their feelings from others, but this won’t shake them too much, for neither of them thinks that much about the opinion of others anyway. If they manage to mend their philosophical differences and respect each other’s different opinions, they could become one of the warmest relationships in the zodiac. Their main relationship advice would be to always tell the truth to each other and not go crazy about their healthy differences. Their differences are exactly the thing that could make their sexual life more exciting.</p>
