        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aries & Leo</span> Sexual and Intimacy Compatibility</h2></u>
        <p>This is such a warm and passionate connection, in which sparks fly around all the time. They have similar sexual preferences and they definitely take each other seriously, whatever the level of their relationship. As they both have extremely strong personalities, they could fight and make up all the time, but enjoy it in a way some Water signs might find crazy </p>
        <p>They have a sexual connection that cannot be interrupted, changed or faded through time, since they are both individual sources of energy, waiting for someone to follow. Still, if one of them has issues with their ego, they could slump into an energy drain system, where they insult each other and destroy each other’s confidence and libido. This is a very rare possibility, but it is always there when two signs that present an extraordinary soil for the Sun come together. </p>

        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aries & Leo</span> Trust</h2></u>
        <p>There are probably many trust issues in every Aries – Leo couple, but their strong convictions and the need for loyalty mend these problems in most cases. They both think highly of themselves and see how their surroundings react to their partner. Leo is a strong willed, attractive masculine sign, and no matter if male or female, they will have this magnetic aura around them most of the time. This will make Aries strangely jealous and possessive, ready to fight for what belongs to them. Exactly why this problem culminates, for no one can ever possess Leo, the King of the zodiac.   </p>
        <p>Still, their mutual understanding for the passionate nature they share and the determination of both partners to solve any problem that stands in their way, might just make them stay together for years, building security and trust every day.</p>

        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aries & Leo</span> Communication & Intellect</h2></u>
        <p>At first, their conversations will probably be unbelievably energized, full of admiration and respect. As they get closer, it can be expected for them to put in an emotional note, but not a very gentle one for their emotions burn like the Fire element they belong to. This is a certain promise of a lot of fights, loud statements and interruptions. Interestingly, as two very passionate people, they usually get over their fights quickly and don’t care much about specific words spoken in the heat of the moment. The moment they cool down, their relationship will easily go back to normal and their sexual life will blossom every time they fight. </p>
        <p>They are interested in similar things. Aries is interested in Leo, while Leo is interested in everything great about Leo. This is a very nice distribution of interests, since Leo will cherish all the things Aries will say and do for them, and give it all back multiple times greater. This is, of course, the scenario of two healthy individuals in these roles. If one of them has greater psychological issues, their communications will turn to senseless talk about one of them, and their relationship will become a battlefield for the ego where they both constantly need to prove something to each other.  </p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 90%;" aria-valuenow="90" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">90%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aries & Leo</span> Emotions</h2></u>
        <p>Their emotional natures are very similar. Sun is connected to love, pure and simple, not the nurturing kind but the creative, warm, passionate and playful love. Both of these signs have a strongly positioned Sun, growing on the soil made out of the Fire element. They understand each other’s emotional state perfectly, even when one of them would like to flee from the passionate need of the other to give resistance to something small and seemingly irrelevant.  </p>
        <p>Emotional compatibility of this magnitude is a cure for all other imperfections they might encounter, while evolving in time and spicing their sexual relations with even more warmth and emotion then the beginning of their relationship might have promised.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 99%;" aria-valuenow="99" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">99%</b></div>
        </div>      
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aries & Leo</span> Values</h2></u>
        <p>What these two value most is a person’s ability to stay concise and clear. It is almost as if these were the words that describe them. Anything concise needs strong Mars energy, the ruler of Aries, while Leo brings clarity to all. Their only problem is the need they both have to be the leader and the brave one in the relationship. It is not as if they both can’t be brave, but they have a tendency to compare to one another and search for their role as a lead. This can come between them and manifest as a typical battle of the sexes (in case they are of the opposite sex) or as a fight for dominance of any kind, consuming the quality of their relationship only because of their need to be the one with dominant values in general.   </p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 95%;" aria-valuenow="95" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">95%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Aries & Leo</span> Shared Activities</h2></u>
        <p>They have enough energy to do everything together, but the problem is they don’t actually need the same daily routine. Aries loves to be active, walk, exercise and always feels excited when about to do something for the first time. Leo is a sign of fixed quality, a drama queen of signs, the one that wants to show off and go where they can be seen. Leo’s energy is easily focused to coffee shops and places where they can rest, enjoy and be the center of everyone’s attention. This is a waste of time in the eyes of an Aries, always ready for something different and exciting.</p>
        <p>For as long as Aries has the will to initiate their shared activities and compromises for a show off from time to time, they can find things to do together and enjoy them. But if Aries partner gets tired and irritated by Leo’s laziness, there is a big chance they will simply separate their activities all together.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 65%;" aria-valuenow="65" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">65%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Summary</h2></u>
        <p>The relationship of Aries and Leo is passionate and turbulent, but they don’t seem to mind an occasional fight and a sharp word. When they fall in love deeply, they are almost impossible to separate as they stubbornly hold on to the idea of their future together. Although they are not two of the most romantic believers in love, they are passionate in their beliefs and when they find love, they will fight for it until there is literally nothing left of their relationship.  </p>
        <p>It is meaningless to advise gentle behavior or looking for peace, because the entire world of their relationship is based on the element of Fire they share. It is pointless to look for peace, when the opposite of peace is what attracts them in the first place. For as long as they love each other and stay faithful and true, they will be tied up in a relationship they need to fight for every day. Their main objective is to find a way to enjoy the fight and have fun.</p>
