        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Taurus & Sagittarius</span> Sexual and Intimacy Compatibility</h2></u>
        <p>When Taurus thinks of sexuality, Sagittarius is probably the last person on their mind. With their childish attitude that changes with the weather, there seems to be no room for any sexual activity in their life. Although this is a delusion, these signs are too far apart in their basic character to understand each other’s sexuality. Sagittarius would probably think of Taurus as a person who eats and sleeps all day long. There is nothing sexual about it, right? </p>
        <p>It is interesting though, how two people ruled by two beneficent planets such as Venus and Jupiter can’t seem to find sexual satisfaction. The fact is – they can. Although this is a rare scenario, they could actually use their attributes to enhance sexual pleasure Venus would offer. If they understood each other as two individuals who deserve respect, they could find the missing link for a very interesting and fulfilling sex life. Taurus would take care of their Sagittarius partner and keep them satisfied. In return they would get a cheerful soul who knows how to make their relationship exciting. There is so much to be learned about the “light side” of sexuality here, and this could be a fun experience if Taurus loosened up a little and Sagittarius slowed down. </p>
        <p>Although Taurus can be a bit vain about their sexual abilities and performance, in most cases Sagittarius is able to break this wall of strict, sexual tension and lead them to a more relaxed zone where they can relax and experiment.</p>

        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Taurus & Sagittarius</span> Trust</h2></u>
        <p>The sign of Sagittarius is considered something like a synonym for honesty. It is true that representatives of this sign have no idea how to make up a lie, let alone tell it. Still, when it comes to romantic relationships, they often suffer from a Don Juan syndrome and can’t get enough attention from one partner. Taurus finds this repulsive at best, and if a relationship with a Sagittarius partner begins and they start acting this way, there is a big chance they will get dumped.</p>
        <p>Trust between these partners isn’t something to be questioned and analyzed. If they do trust each other they can have a wonderful, trusting relationship for a while, but there is still no guarantee on how long this could last. If they don’t, it won’t be mended whatever they try to do. Usually loss of trust here simply breaks up the relationship and they both go their separate ways with no regret.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 5%;" aria-valuenow="5" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">5%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Taurus & Sagittarius</span> Communication & Intellect</h2></u>
        <p>There are so many beautiful things in the world, and so much to talk about when you think about them. Taurus and Sagittarius both have this joy about them that can be awaken by their relationship. With the Moon exalted in Taurus and Jupiter exalted in Cancer (ruled by the Moon), there is a certain feel, a soul, a tenderness to share between them. Their approaches to life are different, their characters incomparable, but the joy they can feel toward some things is completely the same. </p>
        <p>If they don’t find this shared feeling of joy, they could both learn what bad communication really is. In most cases they can talk about the weather and be fine, but when they have a problem, this turns into a ridiculous conversation that isn’t really a conversation at all. Sagittarius will want to jump out of their skin while waiting for Taurus to finish the sentence, as much as Taurus will look at their Sagittarius partner as a source of all stupidity.</p>
        <p>Taurus is your countryside and Sagittarius is the world, so their problems could easily include disrespect because of their origin or their goals. Although they will rarely end up in a fight or use ugly words, it can sometimes be too obvious how much they don’t care for each other’s worlds and how far apart they really are.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 50%;" aria-valuenow="50" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">50%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Taurus & Sagittarius</span> Emotions</h2></u>
        <p>They are both connected with the Moon in a way, so there are some feelings to be shared. However, Sagittarius doesn’t normally react with much emotion to static, from their perspective boring Taurus nature. If Taurus was a bit more prone to temporary infatuations or platonic relationships, they could fall in love with a Sagittarius enough to overcome the differences between them. Sagittarius on the other hand, is often infatuated and temporarily in love. There is a great chance they will fall in love with a Taurus if they like their physical appearances, but they won’t last in those feelings for long enough to gently lead Taurus to mutual love. </p>
        <p>Their pace is off and they rarely get in sync with their emotions. Most relationships between a Taurus and a Sagittarius partner that manage to last, are those that started as a friendship and had a chance to develop emotionally for years without them actually being in a romantic relationship.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 25%;" aria-valuenow="25" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">25%</b></div>
        </div>      
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Taurus & Sagittarius</span> Values</h2></u>
        <p>The combination of signs of Taurus and Sagittarius is a “flower child” full of love, understanding for the world and ultimately humane. They could support each other’s utopian worlds a bit too passionately, and this could lead to one of them, or both, being in a delusion about what reality is about. There is too much love and happiness in the world if they start sharing opinions and this can become like a drug to both of them. The practicality of Taurus will usually break this pattern and hit a counter-attack with their reality checks and material issues so they can both remember where their values part ways – to security and utter lack of it.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 60%;" aria-valuenow="60" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">60%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Taurus & Sagittarius</span> Shared Activities</h2></u>
        <p>Food. That is mostly what they both would share. Taurus might not actually share food with joy, but they will certainly like to share the activity of eating. It could be quite easy for them to find other things to do together, too. The problem will surface the moment Taurus wants to go home and spend an evening in their warm bed, while Sagittarius’ fun has just begun. They don’t share the same passion toward the same things, and although they might have fun being together, their priorities are not the same. The Fire energy of Sagittarius will be put off by Taurus’ Earth personality and this will be tedious for both of them.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 20%;" aria-valuenow="20" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">20%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Summary</h2></u>
        <p>With their inner beauty and the understanding they share in search of the truth to life, these two might seem as a perfect couple. However, every positive needs a negative to complete it, and when we really observe, we can notice that often a Taurus and a Sagittarius don’t even get attracted to each other. Taurus needs earthly pleasures in their relationships and as a fixed, Earth sign it is the slowest of all signs. This is not exactly someone who can easily understand the fast, changeable and fiery Sagittarius.</p>
