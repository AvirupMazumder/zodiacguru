        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Taurus & Cancer</span> Sexual and Intimacy Compatibility</h2></u>
        <p>Someone might think that Taurus and Cancer are two of the most asexual signs in the entire zodiac. This is an instinctive assumption based on the fact that both signs don’t care for Mars very much, meaning they don’t care for instinctive sex. They would probably never have the urge to have sex just for the sake of it, but this doesn’t in any case mean they are asexual. </p>
        <p>Taurus is a sign of physical pleasure. Ruled by Venus, the planet of feminine sexuality, Taurus needs to approach their sexual experiences with the same studiousness with which they would approach any other thing in their life. They need to see, touch, smell, feel everything on their partner’s body and enjoy making them satisfied. With Cancer’s need for closeness and the lack of ability to make their sexual life light and carefree, Taurus seems to have the perfect touch to relax them and build trust within their sexual relationship. </p>
        <p>With the lack of Mars comes the lack of initiative, and this could be their problem when it comes to sex. In case they both don’t have a sexual drive stronger than their love for food, they could end up in an asexual relationship, in which they would lie around the house, cook, eat and gain weight all day long.</p>

        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Taurus & Cancer</span> Trust</h2></u>
        <p>When Taurus and Cancer fall in love with each other, they base their entire relationship on the feel of their partner. There is not much that can be hidden from this sensitive, “sixth” sense these two can share when they connect. It would take a lot to break their trust and this would certainly mean the end of their relationship. In most situations, none of them has the need to betray their partner, for their goal is the same – love, family and home.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 99%;" aria-valuenow="99" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">99%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Taurus & Cancer</span> Communication & Intellect</h2></u>
        <p>They share lots of different interests and will easily talk about their relationship. Neither of these signs talks much, but they are perfectly capable of understanding each other’s silence and give each word a lot of significance. Their most common topics would include love, home and children, except when they feel unready or when they are too young. It is important to understand that these are not the only issues on their minds, though. Whatever their current interests, they will communicate it in a slow, sensitive manner, leading a conversation to a point of deep mutual understanding.  </p>
        <p>Still, Taurus can be truly stubborn at times. It doesn’t really matter if they are right or not, for they simply close up for any further conversation as soon as one of their true convictions is touched. Cancer can’t really do that much when this happens. They can try and be even more gentle and compassionate. In case they are close to enlightened, this will certainly work. If not, they will get really emotional and discover that their Taurus partner in fact drives them crazy. As a result, Taurus will see their partner as a real lunatic, waving their hands for no reason and showing no rational behavior whatsoever. </p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 80%;" aria-valuenow="80" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">80%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Taurus & Cancer</span> Emotions</h2></u>
        <p>Taurus and Cancer are the rulers of the entire warm, earthly emotional world. It is not just due to their sensitivity, but the combination of their emotional expression is something almost unimaginable. While Cancer feels, senses and takes care of their Taurus partner in the emotional realm, Taurus will give love back through physical tenderness, material security and the gentle touch of practical sense that Cancer needs. When this cycle happens several times, their love seems like a chain reaction that will never stop growing. </p>
        <p>If they meet in supporting circumstances, when they don’t need to fight for each other or the possibility of their love, every emotion should simply build up on the previous one and things between them should run smoothly. But if they stumble upon an obstacle of any kind, before their love for each other develops, they will probably be discouraged and never discover what they might have felt if only they fought for one another. If they do fall in love, they will not lack the energy to fight for their relationship, no matter the obstacles.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 99%;" aria-valuenow="99" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">99%</b></div>
        </div>      
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Taurus & Cancer</span> Values</h2></u>
        <p>Most of all, they both value life and peace. Since the Moon is the ruler of the sign of Cancer and exalted in Taurus, they both deeply value all things the Moon represents – family, compassion, understanding and bliss.  </p>
        <p>However, there can be a certain divergence in their view of the material world. Cancer is a Water sign, much more focused on the value of emotion, while Taurus will be turned to financial security. This usually reflects the fear Taurus feels when it comes to their material existence being in question. In the eyes of Cancer this may seem superficial for they have a tendency to think of material reality in an idealistic way. If they have a family together, these issues should settle, because the love of Cancer partner to their children combined with their desire to give them everything they need, easily shifts their perspective and teaches them about the true value of money.</p>

        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Taurus & Cancer</span> Shared Activities</h2></u>
        <p>We could say that they might share every single activity any of them thinks of, but this is not that often called an “activity”. Most of the time and especially if they both have demanding jobs, they will simply share the activity of sleeping, eating or doing nothing. This is not a question of laziness, but more of an exaggerated need for the pleasure of rest. When shared, it seems to multiply and grow beyond both of their rational minds.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 90%;" aria-valuenow="90" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">90%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Summary</h2></u>
        <p>Taurus and Cancer present the gentlest couple of the zodiac. When they fall in love, they will rarely find the reason to separate, because of their shared emotional goals for love, understanding, family and the feeling of home. This is the relationship that seems like a perpetuum mobile of love, in case both partners don’t already have too much emotional baggage that makes them unable to give and receive this depth of emotion. Even if they do, with no obstacles on the way, they will likely learn to forgive and forget as the flow of their relationship takes them to what they always desired.  </p>
