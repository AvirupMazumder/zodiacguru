        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Cancer & Pisces</span> Sexual and Intimacy Compatibility</h2></u>
        <p>Cancer and Pisces are almost always brought together by a romantic love. Their sexual connection is usually primarily emotional. Pisces partner might seem a bit weird and kinky to Cancer, but they should have a feel for each other, strong enough for both of them to enrich their sexual relationship with their own quality. </p>
        <p>Cancer will bring intimacy into their sex life and the meaning behind the act. They will nurture their partner and care about their pleasure, giving them a stable and a safe approach to a healthy sex life. Pisces will bring in change, creativity, inspiration and probably a lot of sensuality due to the fact that this is the sign that exalts Venus. The beauty of this connection is in the emotion they share and the way they cherish each other and respect each other’s sensitivity.</p>
        <p>Their main problem might arise because Cancer can be somewhat traditional when it comes to sex and Pisces partner doesn’t really understand this. Pisces’ need to connect and feel love is larger than any sort of rule humankind might have made for love. However, in most cases they will be tender enough to inspire their Cancer partner to let go of their rigid attitudes and shame, and give in to the beauty of sexual exchange of emotions.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 85%;" aria-valuenow="85" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">85%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Cancer & Pisces</span> Trust</h2></u>
        <p>It is a good thing that Cancer is usually not aggressive or pushy, or they could easily get dishonesty from Pisces as a response to their tendency to create intimacy and a happy home at any cost. Pisces don’t really understand marriage except as a part of a fairytale ending or because of all that lace, and Cancer will usually want a wedding as a crowning of a loving relationship. This could be recognized as pressure to some point and this could lead to Pisces partner getting scared.</p>
        <p>When Pisces get scared, they somehow fail to tell the truth even on silly things in their life, because they feel the need to distance themselves from any pressure they might feel. It is a good thing that Cancer understands this and easily separates lies from intimacy. Whatever the situation, they will both probably be patient enough to have just enough trust in one another for their relationship to work out.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 70%;" aria-valuenow="70" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">70%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Cancer & Pisces</span> Communication & Intellect</h2></u>
        <p>As changeable as Pisces are, they always have something to talk about. This can be inspiring or irritating to Cancer who would maybe rather deal with “real information”. Usually they communicate just fine, but there are situations in which they could float away on an idea made out of words. Cancer is looking for someone with clarity on the use and the practicality of everything they mention. Pisces is everything but focused on practicality in most everyday situations.</p>
        <p>If Pisces partner learns to be more silent, relying on their feelings, and starts fighting for what they wish for, they could sweep their Cancer off their feet. Unfortunately, their entire relationship will not last very long if only words are spoken but deeds don’t follow. Cancer’s opposing sign is after all – Capricorn, and they need a partner able to constructively use things, situations and emotions.</p>

          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 85%;" aria-valuenow="85" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">85%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Cancer & Pisces</span> Emotions</h2></u>
        <p>Cancer can understand the sensitive nature of their Pisces partner better than anyone else. Everything that seems easygoing and positive might have a hidden negative note in the Pisces world, and Cancer feels rather than listens, which makes them a perfect companion for someone like Pisces. When they sense this deep understanding, Pisces partner will return the favor by absolute tenderness and finally open up to their Cancer partner. When they find this shared point of intimacy where true emotions are shared, this will affect all other segments of their relationship and be a fuel for it to have a fairytale ending.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 99%;" aria-valuenow="99" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">99%</b></div>
        </div>      
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Cancer & Pisces</span> Values</h2></u>
        <p>This is where the difference in their character really comes to focus. As much as they will both value being loved and cared for, Cancer will value a stable emotional situation and a cozy home to come to, while Pisces will probably value any chance for an emotional rollercoaster more. It is often said that Pisces idealize partners and different things in life, but in fact they get depressed when there is no magic and perfect beauty surrounding them. If their day to day life with a Cancer partner becomes anything similar to a boring routine, they will find a way to run off, find a lover or create any sort of truly exciting circumstances.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 25%;" aria-valuenow="25" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">25%</b></div>
        </div> 
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;"><span style="color:#00FFFF;">Cancer & Pisces</span> Shared Activities</h2></u>
        <p>When they meet and start their relationship, they will probably have a lot of things to do together. A relationship with a Pisces partner is always exciting and inspirational, and Cancer will give it strength, stability and roots. At the beginning, this may seem like a great arrangement, but in time, Pisces might want too much activity for what Cancer partner really needs. This wouldn’t be much of a problem if they would say this to their partner without fear of any one of them getting hurt. If they start bending the truth, Cancer will feel their trust beginning to fade and this could begin a series on problems between them, that could have been easily avoided.</p>
        <div class="progress" style="margin-bottom:40px; margin-top:30px; height:30px;">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-dark" role="progressbar" style="width: 70%;" aria-valuenow="70" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"><b style="font-size:15px;">70%</b></div>
        </div>
        <u><h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Summary</h2></u>
        <p>As two Water signs, Cancer and Pisces connect through emotions, usually as soon as they lay eyes on each other. This is one of the typical combinations of zodiac signs for love at first sight. Their main challenge is hidden in the changeable nature of the sign of Pisces, not because it is there, but because they might fear to show it. Their biggest problem lies in the fact that they give priority to different types of love in their life. If passion and sensual, sexual love isn’t there, Pisces will rarely be satisfied with the love they get from their family, and Cancer would find a life without a family nest very depressing. A fine balance needs to be made between excitement and stability, and they could be one of the most wonderful couples of the zodiac – Cancer inspired and Pisces with a feel of home.</p>
